# 11 Notes-Crafter

## Description
For this project I struggeled with the start but with the help of my tutor I was able to find some ground to start on. After looking through again the day's works I
learnt a lot about how to make servers and set up routes. I was still struggled with the end but after a bit more assistance I was able to get the server to work allowing
for the html to open with the js and css working allowing for users to add and delete notes ect.
